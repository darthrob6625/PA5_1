## Module 5: Practical Application 1

### Problem Statement 
The purpose of this module is to analyze the survey responses, which include over 12,000 entries, and identify the characteristics associated with a higher likelihood of accepting a coupon. Without applying any filters, more than 7,000 individuals accepted a coupon, representing approximately 56% of the total respondents. The dataset includes over 20 variables that can be used to further refine the analysis criteria.

### Data Cleaning
Upon initial inspection, the car specification column contained predominantly missing values, so I chose to drop it entirely. Additionally, five other columns each had approximately 200 missing entries, which is less than 1 percent of the total dataset, so I elected not to drop or modify those values.

In hindsight, I should have converted many of the string encoded variables, for example, age categories, into integer or numeric formats. Doing so would have made the numerical analysis and visualization more straightforward. If time allows, I plan to revisit this assignment and reformat the data before proceeding with the analysis.
